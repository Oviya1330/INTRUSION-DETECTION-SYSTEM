## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Agriculture is one of the most important industries in 
any economy since it plays a big role in the food supply chain. 
Agricultural fields, on the other hand, confront a number of issues, 
including animal encroachment, which can cause severe crop 
damage and loss. Traditional animal control tactics, such as 
electrical fences, physical barriers, and scarecrows, can be 
inefficient, time-consuming and a serious threat to animal lives. 
The animals either become entangled in the fence's wire mesh or 
were electrocuted by the electric lines. To overcome these 
problems we propose a unique method that involves image 
processing-based animal incursion detection system in agricultural 
fields using Raspberry Pi and deep learning technique, mainly the 
YOLOv7. This technology captures live video feeds of agricultural 
fields using a camera and analyses them using deep learning 
algorithm to detect any animal invasions. If an intrusion is 
detected, the system emits specific repellent sounds for specific 
animal via speakers in order to scare them away and alerts the 
farmers by sending SMS. This method provides an efficient and 
practical alternative for crop damage prevention and human
wildlife conflict reduction in agricultural settings.

## OBJECTIVES
To develop a robust and accurate deep learning model 
using YOLO V7 and Fast RCNN that can detect and 
classify animal intrusions in agricultural fields using 
Raspberry Pi in order to prevent crop damage and animal
deaths due to electrocution from illegal power fence. 

• To train the deep learning model on a large dataset of 
animal images to improve its accuracy and generalization 
ability. 

• To optimize the model's hyperparameters, such as learning 
rate, batch size, and regularization, to achieve the best 
performance on the test dataset. 

• To deploy the trained model on cameras placed in the 
agricultural fields to detect and classify animal intrusions 
in real-time. 

• To generate alerts whenever an animal intrusion is detected 
using Raspberry Pi, allowing farmers or operators to take 
necessary actions from further damage. to protect their crops
